# Changelog

All notable changes to CareerDossierTeX will be documented in this file.

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The structure of this file is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Before `v1.0.0`, breaking changes may occur, but they must be documented here and in `docs/MIGRATION.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `careerdossier-letter.cls`: the English industry cover-letter class. US Letter
  geometry with one-inch margins; no user-facing class options (family, paper,
  language, and theme are fixed, and any option is rejected with an actionable
  message); page numbers disabled by default. `\CDossierLetterSetup` for letter
  metadata (`date`, `recipient-name`, `recipient-title`,
  `recipient-organization`, `recipient-address`, `subject`, `salutation`,
  `closing`) with English defaults for `date`, `salutation`, and `closing` and
  unknown keys rejected. `\MakeCDossierLetterhead` (centered sender identity,
  date, collapsing recipient block, optional subject, salutation) and
  `\MakeCDossierClosing` (closing, signature space, validated `name`). An absent
  recipient field, subject, or contact field leaves no stray line or separator.
- `examples/industry/letter-industry.tex`: the supported cover-letter example,
  sharing `examples/profiles/profile-english.tex` with the résumé example.
- Cover-letter tests: smoke fixtures for the supported builds and the required
  failure paths (missing `name`, unknown class option, unknown
  `\CDossierLetterSetup` key), layout-stress fixtures (`tests/layout/`) for long
  fields and a two-page letter, and a letter extraction fixture
  (`tests/extraction/`) pinning the recipient block, contact line, and reading
  order when optional fields are absent.
- `careerdossier-resume.cls`: the English industry résumé class. US Letter
  geometry; `fontsize` (`10pt`, `11pt`) and `density` (`compact`, `standard`)
  options with actionable rejection of unsupported keys and values; page numbers
  disabled by default; `\CDossierSection`, the `CDossierEntry` environment, and
  the `CDossierItemize` list.
- Shared entry-heading primitive in `careerdossier-components.sty` that renders a
  required title with optional organization, location, and dates and leaves no
  stray separators when fields are absent.
- `examples/industry/resume-english.tex` and `examples/profiles/profile-english.tex`:
  the supported résumé example and its shared profile data.
- Smoke tests (`tests/smoke/`) for the supported builds and the required failure
  paths, layout-stress fixtures (`tests/layout/`) for long fields and a two-page
  résumé, and a résumé extraction fixture (`tests/extraction/`) that pins the
  contact line and reading order.
- Initial project scope, phased roadmap, and Phase 1 implementation plan.
- Repository architecture and documentation plan.
- GitHub issue, branch, pull-request, CI, and release workflow documentation.
- Draft user documentation for the planned `v0.1.0` public interface.
- Contributor workflow and coding conventions.
- LaTeX Project Public License version 1.3c.
- `docs/API.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/MIGRATION.md`, resolving links that `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` already pointed to.
- GitHub issue templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`) and a pull-request template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`).
- `docs/guides/ats-and-extraction.md`: design and reference guide for ATS-safe, extractable XeLaTeX output (single-column layout, font/ligature policy, `/ActualText` limits, extraction testing, tagging status). Reference material only; scope-gated to distinguish Phase 1 from planned work.

### Changed

- Clarified that the résumé, cover-letter class, shared profile interface, and CI workflow remain pre-release targets until implemented and verified.
- Standardized licensing language around LPPL maintenance status and the current maintainer.

### Fixed

- Corrected relative links in `CONTRIBUTING.md` that assumed the file lived under `docs/` instead of the repository root.

### Release preparation

When `v0.1.0` is ready:

1. move completed entries from `[Unreleased]` into a new section;
2. use the heading `## [0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD`;
3. verify that the README and API documentation describe only tested behavior;
4. confirm that both supported examples compile locally and in CI;
5. create a new empty `[Unreleased]` section above the release.
